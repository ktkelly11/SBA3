          Welcome to the secondhand instrument donation site, where we recognize
          the importance of music education, especially in a public school
          setting, and try to get as many no longer used instruments into the
          hands of students who need them. This website is inspired by my
          wonderful mother, Margaret. She is so giving and always thinking of
          others. She is constantly looking for or thrifting instruments that
          maybe just need a little fixing up. She does this because my brother
          is a public school music teacher in Vermont, and his wife, my
          sister-in-law is a music therapist. With two musicians in our family
          who know of lots of students in need of instruments, it is wonderful
          to help support those interested in studying music.
