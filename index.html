          Welcome to the secondhand instrument donation site. This website is
          inspired by my wonderful mother, Margaret. She is wonderfully giving
          and always thinking of others.
          <!--  
            Two people she is consistently trying
          to help are my brother, a music teacher in Vermont, and his wife, my
          sister-in-law, who is a music therapist. With two musicians in the
          family always looking for instruments to provide their students, my
          mom is constantly looking for unused instruments that maybe need just
          a bit of fixing up, and could find a new home with a student in need
          in a public school somewhere. -->
