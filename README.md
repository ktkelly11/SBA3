# Second Hand Instruments

## Where the idea came from

My brother is a middle school music teacher and my sister-in-law is a music therapist. They are always telling stroies about students/patients that they work with who could use an instrument and my mom has taken to purchasing any instrument she sees in a thrift shop or online so that she can donate them to students in need. She is also the one who suggested that it would be really cool if we could create a online source where people could offer to donate instruments they or their children/family members are no longer using and they could get a second life benefiting a music student!
